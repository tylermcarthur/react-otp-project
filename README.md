# react-otp-project
React-otp-project is a single page application designed to host League of Legends character data in an easy to read and navigate format, and to allow saving of a favorite champion so that the favorited champion will be first to be displayed upon login. 

## Installation
  This code is completely open-source, anyone that wants to use it feel free to fork and clone this repo down then in the CLI run the ./Server/server.js file and in another CLI run ./Client/npm start. This will allow you to have a seperate front-end & back-end server.

## usage 
  The entire front-end is built off of ReactJS and uses states to store data and dynamicly update the page. The picture from the landing scene is from a downloaded file of images that is within this repo so that the client does not have to wait for the api to send all ~150 images. The login system connects to a SQL database housed within Server and the favorites button saves the infromation of the selected page to said database.
